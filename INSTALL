INSTALLATION GUIDE

The installation is yet not script-automated. It is quite easy to manually
setup though!

1. Let the executable `bibrarian` be under your `PATH` environment variable.
   Possible ways:

   - Append bibrarian project directory to your `PATH`

        export PATH=$PATH:<BIBRARIAN_PROJECT_DIR>

     and put the above line in your ~/.bashrc file.

   - Soft-link script `bibrarian` to somewhere already in `PATH`

        $ cd <SOMEWHERE_IN_PATH>
        $ ln -s <BIBRARIAN_PROJECT_DIR>/bibrarian .


   To test, do the following in your terminal and expect a help message.

        $ bibrarian -h

2. (optional) Install the plugin for your favorite editor.

   - vim: Let vim source file `editor_plugins/bibrarian.vim` on startup.
   - emacs: (plugin to be implemented)
